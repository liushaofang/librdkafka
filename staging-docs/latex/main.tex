librdkafka is the Apache Kafka C/C++ client library.\hypertarget{main_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{main_intro}
For an introduction and manual to librdkafka see INTRODUCTION.md\hypertarget{main_conf}{}\section{Configuration}\label{main_conf}
librdkafka is highly configurable to meet any deployment demands. It is usually safe to leave most configuration properties to their default values.

See CONFIGURATION.md for the full list of supported configuration properties.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
Application developers are recommended to provide a non-\/hardcoded interface to librdkafka's string based name-\/value configuration property interface, allowing users to configure any librdkafka property directly without alterations to the application. This allows for seamless upgrades where linking to a new version of librdkafka automatically provides new configuration based features.
